# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
- **Features:** 30 numeric features related to cell nuclei characteristics.
- **Target:** Binary classification — `0` for malignant and `1` for benign.

> The dataset is typically loaded from `sklearn.datasets`, but you can also download it from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## 🚀 Features of the Project

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Feature selection and correlation heatmap
- Model training using `Logistic Regression`, `SVM`, `Random Forest`, etc.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visual comparison of multiple model performances

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
cd breast-cancer-classification
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
